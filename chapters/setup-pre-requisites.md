## Local Setup

### Visual Studio
First, download VS Code to your computer: https://code.visualstudio.com
Follow the video at minute [2:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S320N3sxinE&t=140s) to download the Python extension in VS Code.

#### For Windows users, we need to install Python:

1. Go to [python.org (Windows)](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).
2. Look for a Python 3.XX.X release under Stable Releases that says "Windows installer (64-bit)" and click on the link.
3. Once it's downloaded, open the installer to install Python 3 on your Windows machine.

### Pip

The main feature that comes with installing Python is our package manager pip! Pip is used to download all external Python packages from Python Package Index called PyPI.

To download a package, go into your terminal and run:
```
pip install pandas
```
