# Class 2 Exercises

## Exercise 1

The worldâ€™s tallest buildings are the following:
```
tallest_buildings = np.array([2717, 2227, 2073, 1972, 1966, 1819, 1776])
```
Oh wait, all the heights are using feet. Can you convert this array to meters?

```math
meters = feet / 3.28084
```
Use basic operations to create a new array with all the measurements in meters.
